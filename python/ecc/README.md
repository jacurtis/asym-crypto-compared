To demonstrate Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in Python, you can use the `cryptography` library, which provides a 
straightforward way to work with ECC. ECC is a public-key cryptography system that relies on the mathematics of elliptic
curves. Here's a basic example of how to generate ECC key pairs, sign and verify a message using ECC in Python.

**In the example:**

We generate an ECC key pair using the ec.generate_private_key method. You can choose different elliptic curves like 
`ec.SECP256R1()` or `ec.SECP384R1()` based on your security requirements.

We serialize the public key to PEM format, which can be shared with others.

We specify a message (a bytes-like object) that we want to sign.

For signing, we use the private key's sign method with the ECDSA algorithm and SHA-256 hashing.

To verify the signature, we use the public key's verify method, which will raise InvalidSignature if the signature is 
not valid.

This code demonstrates the basic operations of ECC cryptography in Python using the cryptography library. It showcases 
key pair generation, signing, and verification. Ensure that you handle errors appropriately and implement proper error 
checking and handling mechanisms in a production environment.
